## Introduction
Obstacle avoidance is a critical aspect of autonomous navigation systems. This project leverages **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** and the **TurtleBot3 platform** to implement and enhance an obstacle avoidance algorithm using the **Navigation 2 (Nav2) stack**.

## Objective
The primary goal is to enable the TurtleBot3 to navigate autonomously in a dynamic environment while avoiding obstacles in real time. This project is part of the **Autonomous Systems and Robotics course at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences**.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Requirements
- TurtleBot3 (Burger or Waffle Pi)
- Lidar Sensor
- Ubuntu 22.04-based computer

### Software Requirements
- ROS 2 Humble distribution
- Nav2 Stack
- Gazebo Simulator
- Rviz2 Visualization Tool
- Python/C++ programming environment

## Installation Guide

1. Install ROS 2 Humble:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
2. Install TurtleBot3 and Nav2 packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot3*
   sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup

4. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/ryanmaruf615/ros2_obstacle_avoidance.git
   cd ..
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash

Launching the System
1. Launch TurtleBot3 simulation:
    ```bash
    ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py
2. Run the Obstacle Avoidance Node:
    ```bash
    ros2 run obstacle_avoidance avoid_obstacles    
Results

Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.

Smooth navigation through dynamic environments.

Visualization of navigation path in Rviz2.

Future Improvements

Implement advanced path-planning algorithms.

Integrate machine learning-based object recognition.

Improve performance in outdoor environments.
